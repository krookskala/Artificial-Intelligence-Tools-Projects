## Project Overview

This repository aims to provide a practical implementation of various AI algorithms. These projects demonstrate the core concepts behind the algorithms and provide users with executable code to test, experiment, and extend. The implementations are designed for educational purposes, but can be adapted for more advanced use cases.

1. **Language Recognition Neural Network:** 
- Implements a one-layer neural network for identifying the language of a text based on ASCII character frequency.
- Automatically adjusts the network's structure based on the number of languages in the training dataset.

2. **Huffman Coding Implementation:**
- A lossless data compression algorithm that uses a custom-built priority queue to generate a Huffman tree and assign codes to input symbols based on their frequency.


3. **K-Means Clustering:**
- Implements the k-means algorithm, which partitions a dataset into k clusters using Euclidean distance. It also calculates cluster purity and minimizes the sum of distances within clusters.

4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):**
- A simple classification algorithm that assigns a label to a point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in a feature space. Includes user interaction for data loading and classification tasks.

5. **Brute-Force Knapsack Solver:** 
- Solves the classic knapsack problem using brute-force methods to explore all possible combinations of items, ensuring the most valuable set is chosen without exceeding the weight limit.

6. **Perceptron Algorithm:** 
- Implements the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification, allowing users to train and test the model with custom data and fine-tune learning parameters.

Each project is equipped with detailed documentation to help users understand and utilize the implementations effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for creating algorithms and managing data.

- **Java:** Used for implementing some of the more computationally intensive algorithms.

- **Various AI and ML Libraries:** Includes TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciPy, NumPy, etc., to support various AI operations.
## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository:

**Installation Requirements**

Make sure Python and MongoDB are installed on your system. MongoDB is used for data persistence, storing user sessions and leaderboard information.

**Setup and Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Artificial-Intelligence-Tools-Projects
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:**
```bash
cd [Project-Directory-Name]
```
For example, to access the K-Means Clustering project:
```bash
cd K-Means
```
3. **Follow the Project-Specific Setup Instructions found in each project's README.**

## Run the Project:

Each project typically contains a main script or entry point. For example, to run a Python project:
```bash
python main.py
```
Or to compile and run a Java project:
```bash
javac [ClassName].java
java [ClassName]
```
# Usage
Each project has its own specific instructions for usage, including how to provide input data and how to interpret the results. Please refer to the individual project directories for detailed information.

## Common Usage Steps:
1. **Prepare Input Data:** Depending on the project, data may need to be structured in a specific format (e.g., CSV for kNN or text files for Language Recognition).

2. **Run the Program:** Execute the main script or program and provide any required inputs such as file paths or parameters (e.g., number of clusters for K-Means).

3. **Analyze Output:** Review the output generated by the program, which may include results such as classifications, cluster information, or compressed data.
