This project implements the k-means clustering algorithm using the Euclidean distance metric. It is designed to be dynamic, handling any number of attributes automatically recognized from input data. The program includes interactive prompts for user input to specify the number of clusters (k) and provides detailed outputs including the sum of distances within clusters and the purity of each cluster.

## About the Project

The k-means algorithm seeks to partition a set of observations into a specified number (k) of clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares. This implementation not only performs clustering but also calculates and displays the purity of each cluster with respect to available labels, providing insights into the clustering performance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Attribute Recognition:** Automatically detects the number of attributes in the dataset.

- **Interactive Cluster Specification:** Allows users to specify the number of clusters (k) at runtime.

- **Continuous Updates:**  Displays the sum of distances and cluster purity after each iteration.

- **Convergence Checking:** Stops execution when clusters no longer change, ensuring efficiency.


## Getting Started

To begin using the k-means clustering system, follow these instructions:

- **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krookskala/Artificial-Intelligence-Tools-Projects/tree/main/K-Means.git

   ```

- **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    cd K-Means

    ```

- **Run the Script:**
    ```sh
    python main.py

    ```




## Usage
1. **Specify Number of Clusters:**
- Input the desired number of clusters (k) when prompted.

2. **View Iterative Outputs:**
- Observe the sum of distances within clusters and the purity of each cluster after each iteration.

3. **Analyze Results:**
- Examine the final clustering results once the program terminates upon stability.
